### **1. Make requirements less stupid.**

Your requirements are definitely stupid. It does not matter who gave them to you.

It's particularly dangerous if a smart person gave you the requirements, because you may not question them enough.

Everyone is wrong sometimes. So make the requirements less dumb.

And try really hard to delete unnecessary parts or processes.

### **2. Delete unnecessary parts or processes.**

If you're not occasionally adding back things you deleted, you're not deleting enough.

Most people have the bias of "let's add this just in case we might need it later."

But these "just in case" additions can go on endlessly.

### **3. Simplify or optimize.**

This is step three for a reason.

The most common mistake smart engineers make is optimizing something that should not exist.

Do not optimize something that should not exist.

Delete it instead.

### **4. Accelerate.**

You're moving too slow. Go faster.

But only after solving steps 1-3 first.

If you're going in the wrong direction, do not speed up.

"If you're digging your own grave, don't dig faster. Stop digging."

### **5. Automate.**

But automation must be the last step.

I have personally made the mistake of running these five steps in reverse order many times.

### **Summary**

1. **Make requirements less stupid.**
2. **Delete unnecessary parts or processes.**
3. **Don't optimize what shouldn't exist.**
4. **Accelerate. But only after solving 1-3 first.**
5. **Automate last.**

Do these in reverse order? **You're dead.**
