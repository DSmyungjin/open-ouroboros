# Open Questions

Unresolved items only. When you resolve one:
1. Record the resolution as a decision in `decisions.md`
2. Delete the question from this file

This file should only contain questions that are still open.
Use namespace prefixes when multiple teams share this file (e.g., `[E-Q#]`, `[L-Q#]`).

- [Q1] At what scale (number of session logs) does grep become too slow, requiring a search index?
- [Q2] Should session logs be per-team or per-agent-role within a team?
- [Q3] How should conflicting decisions between agents be resolved in decisions.md?
